# Strudel + Monaco

This is only a test! I wanted to see how hard it would be to spin up a new editor using Monaco (from the VSCode team) rather than the default editor that Strudel uses (CodeMirror).

To try it out:

1. Clone this repo or run `npx degit https://github.com/andy-stewart-design/strudel-editor`.
2. Install all dependencies by running `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm run dev`

NOTE: this is not a full-fledged implementation of the web-based [Strudel editor](https://strudel.cc/). It is a proof-of-concept to test feasibility.
